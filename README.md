# classification-cats-v-dogs
I used TensorFlow to build and train a model to predict whether an image is of a dog or a cat with ~80% accuracy, based on a tutorial from Youtuber sentdex.

This was such an in-depth tutorial with so many great explanations about both TensorFlow and regression models in general, I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to get stared with machine learning!

The hardest part about going through this tutorial was debugging errors caused by deprecated code. I was really excited to find this tutorial because it was so comprehensive, and I didn't realize until I had already started that it was published in 2017 - as you can imagine, there were quite a few instances of methods that were no longer supported, or needed versions of a library that were too old to use without downgrading all my other libraries. 

Still, I learned so much through this tutorial, and I' very proud of my results. I'm excited to take this project further in the future and build more ML applications. 

If you would like to run this project and see how it looks, you will need to download the necessary files from this Kaggle page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data

I used Jupyter Notebook to create this progam, but I converted it to a .py file that can be run in any IDE that supports Python. Make sure that you look through the comments, as you will need to train the model and create the .npy files the first time you run it. Look for comments that tell you which lines to comment/uncomment and you should be all set!

Thanks for reading!
